Videos can be found here (data is now attached directly to this item, where you will also find the lab procudedures). The videos should help you see the technique and access all the data you need. Before you begin work, read the word document entitled "Read Me First". This will give you a quick primer on how to deal with the data. The data that is provided is exactly what comes out of the spectrometer, so this may be your first time converting electronic data to an excel sheet. To do so, open excel first, then, when you go to open the file, you may need to change the file type from the dropdown menu to "all files." From there, follow the prompts. The data is "space delimited," so choose that option.
be ready with questions. Otherwise, you will be trying to complete this lab while also working on Exam 3.
