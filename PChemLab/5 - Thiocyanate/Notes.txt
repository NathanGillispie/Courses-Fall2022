This will explore the effect of electrolytes on complexation equilibrium.
The excel sheet contains the raw data for this experiment. Calculations are quite intricate. Use %T to get absorbance (column already provided), then I suggest using volume and molarity to calculate moles of each ion. Remember, that includes K+ and H+, since they will also contribute to the overall ionic strength. I recommend that you read the lab procedure carefully (maybe more than once) so that you will understand what was done to get this data. That will help you make sense of the calculations.
Before you try to analyze any data, build out your spreadsheet of needed information. Each trial should be a row in your spreadsheet. The columns will be the different values. Be sure you keep track of the number of moles of each compound and the total volume, as both could change during the experiment. Then, use those to calculate concentrations (in molarity) for each ion.
